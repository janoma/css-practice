# CSS Practice

Playground for my study of CSS, which I tend to do but never leave a reproducible example, so it's time to fix that.

## Cases

- [#1](src/case1.html): element centered vertically and horizontally on the page
- [#2](src/case2.html): element centered vertically and horizontally inside a div
- [#3](src/case3.html): painfully bright green background
- [#4](src/case4.html): animation order changes outcome
- [#5](src/case5.html): some layout thing I wanted to try
