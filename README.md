# CSS Practice

Playground for my study of CSS, which I tend to do but never leave a reproducible example, so it's time to fix that.

## Cases

- [#1](src/case1.html): element centered vertically and horizontally on the page
- [#2](src/case2.html): element centered vertically and horizontally inside a div
